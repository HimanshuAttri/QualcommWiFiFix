installing ubuntu 14.04 or above along with windows 10 dual boot on Lenovo Z51 .Wireless is not working properly in ubuntu.Its not listing the networks. On the other hand in windows its working absolutely fine.
Now here is the fix to it just download Fix.tar.gz and follow readme instructions

one more thing whenever ubuntu will have an update and if you install those updates you will be rolled back to your same problem of WiFi not working. In that case do these steps again.
